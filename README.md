# UKB-Git-Audit-Tool
The UKB-Git-Audit-Tool is a utility designed to audit Git repositories for potential exposure of UK Biobank data. It performs a comprehensive scan of the repositoryâ€™s commit historyâ€”including deleted filesâ€”to identify and flag content that may contain sensitive information.

The tool supports both executable and Python script modes, making it suitable for a range of environments and workflows.


## Features

- **Automated Scanning:** Scans your Git repository for files containing UK Biobank data.
- **Comprehensive Audit:** Checks full commit history, including deleted files.
- **Clear Reporting:** Generates detailed reports highlighting potential data breaches.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows as an executable, or can be run as a Python script.

## Getting Started (with the .exe for Windows)

0. **Install** Git on your computer if not done already 
1. **Download** the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/UK-Biobank/UKB-Git-Audit-Tool/releases).
2. **Place** the executable in the root directory of your Git repository.
3. **Run** the ukb-git-audit-tool.exe tool
4. **Enter** option 1 (Run in the current directory)


## Alternative Installation and Usage (Python-based)

If you are unable to run the executable file, you can use the Python source code directly.

### Prerequisites
- Python version >=3.10 and <3.15
- Git must be installed
- Poetry or pip for dependency management

### Installation with pip
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
4. Execute the tool using `python src/main.py`.

### Installation with Poetry
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `poetry install` to set up the environment.
4. Use `poetry run python src/main.py` to execute the tool.

### Script Options
Running the script or executable opens a terminal with the following options:
1. Run in the current directory (recommended for private repositories).
2. Enter a directory path to audit a cloned public repository.
3. Enter a repository URL to clone and audit (public only).
4. Submit a CSV file path for batch auditing multiple URLs.
5. Exit the program.

### Notes on Private Repositories
- Option 1 is recommended for auditing private repositories, as it uses the Git credentials already configured in your local environment.
- Options 2 and 3 attempt to clone the repository using the provided URL. For private repositories, this requires explicit authentication and may fail if credentials are not properly configured.
- If you wish to audit a private repository from another directory, ensure your Git credentials are accessible and provide the repository URL when prompted.
- The tool will clone the repository and perform the audit, but may duplicate the repository inside your current directory (a known issue to be resolved in future versions).

### Output Files
| File Name     | Format    | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audit report          | CSV   | Lists all files in the repository with audit and file metrics     |
| EID frequency table   | CSV   | Tracks potential EIDs and their frequency.                        |
